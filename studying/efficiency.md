### Sleep

This YouTuber talked about a test on sleep and math, and it sounds like if you get enough sleep, your efficiency would double.

That’s a little crazy, but who knows? It sounds like exactly what I’ve been hoping for—doing nothing but sleeping enough. In that case, my brain would connect and absorb the information I gained during the day.

However, in my opinion, our brain also cuts off some useless information. Based on the memory curve, if you don’t review what you’ve learned, you’ll eventually forget everything!

The YouTuber recommended a book called *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker. The core message is the importance of getting at least 7 hours of sleep.

Here are some suggestions:

- Get plenty of bright light during the day
- Reduce blue light exposure in the evening
- Avoid Caffeine
- Maintain a Consistent Wake/Sleep Time
- Keep bedroom dark and cold, around 65 degrees Fahrenheit
- Taking a bath before bed

### Exercise

The Youtuber recommended that you should work out or do some exercise in the middle of studying or before studying, as it will help develop your study efficiency, rather than doing sports after studying.
