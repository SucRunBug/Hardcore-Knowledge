### Sleep

This YouTuber talked about a test on sleep and math, and it sounds like if you get enough sleep, your efficiency would double.

That’s a little crazy, but who knows? It sounds like exactly what I’ve been hoping for—doing nothing but sleeping enough. In that case, my brain would connect and absorb the information I gained during the day.

However, in my opinion, our brain also cuts off some useless information. Based on the memory curve, if you don’t review what you’ve learned, you’ll eventually forget everything!

The YouTuber recommended a book called *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker. The core message is the importance of getting at least 7 hours of sleep.

Here are some suggestions:

- Get plenty of bright light during the day
- Reduce blue light exposure in the evening
- Avoid Caffeine in the evening
- Maintain a Consistent Wake/Sleep Time
- Keep bedroom dark and cold, around 65 degrees Fahrenheit
- Taking a bath before bed

### Exercise

The Youtuber recommended that you should work out or do some exercise in the middle of studying or before studying, as it will help develop your study efficiency, rather than doing sports after studying.

### Environment

The YouTuber talked about his experience of using different positions for different activities: if he studies, he sits in Seat A; if he plays games, he sits in Seat B, and so on. I already knew about this trick, and I’ve tried it myself, but I usually don’t want to switch positions because it’s really inconvenient. If you’re missing something and it’s in another position, you have to walk there and bring it back to your spot. Sometimes, you also find that your position has limited space for what you’re missing. For example, I only have one monitor, one pair of headphones, and one comfortable chair, and I need them for both studying and gaming. So, in the end, I gave up on this plan and just chose one place to do both activities.

Back to the video, he mentioned that noise and distractions can reduce your memory efficiency. So, it's essential to wear a noise-canceling headphones when your environment has buzzing nosie, and you can play some rain sounds, like white noise. However, I prefer to play music I like because it makes me feel more energized.

### Mindset

At the end of the video, he told us that we should shift our mindset from ‘we have to study’ to ‘we get to study.’ He also suggested making a specific plan and sticking to it, and living in ‘day-tight’ compartments.

I don’t want to try this again because I’ve already tried it before. I couldn’t finish my plan, and I kept pushing it to the next day, which led to an endless cycle. Eventually, my plans piled up, leading to a negative mindset. When I think about things I need to do, like passing the IELTS exam, I can’t feel excited about studying English. To me, studying is always boring.
